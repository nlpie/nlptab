Natural Language Processing Type and Annotation Browser (NLP-TAB)
===

A system for integration and visualization of diverse biomedical NLP applications.


About
===

NLP-TAB is a web-based system designed to allow researchers and developers of Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems
to compare the output of several disparate NLP systems to each other or to a manually created reference standard.
The comparison is performed by running the NLP systems on a single corpus of text with subsequent statistical analysis
of co-occurrences between annotations generated by NLP systems. Analysis results are stored and indexed using the
ElasticSearch technology and displayed to end users with a custom web-based interface.


Prerequisites
===

1. An ElasticSearch server running version 2.1.0.
2. JDK 1.8
3. Maven.


Building
===

In order to build the NLP-TAB ElasticSearch plugin run the following command in the NLP-TAB project directory.

    mvn clean package

This will build a ElasticSearch plugin zip file in target/releases, nlptab-{version}.zip. To install the plugin into
your ElasticSearch server you can type:

    bin/plugin install file:/path-to/target/releases/nlptab-{version}.zip


About Us
===

NLP-TAB is developed by the
[University of Minnesota Institute for Health Informatics NLP/IE Group](http://www.bmhi.umn.edu/ihi/research/nlpie/) and
the [Open Health NLP Consortium](http://ohnlp.org/index.php/Main_Page).
